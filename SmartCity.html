      <p class = "body">My next problem was deciding the hierarchy of options. If you were a normal person living in Leganes,<br> what would you want to see first? Why are you looking at the app in the first place? My main problem was that<br> I had to step into the mindset of not just a different person, but a different culture. So, I fell back on what I did know: personas.</p>
      <h3>personas</h3><br>
      <img class = "img-asset" src = "img\smartcity\personas.jpg" style = "width: 60%; margin-left: 50px;"><br><br><br>
      <p class = "body"><span class = "emphasisText">Takeaways</span>: My personas help me arrive at a few important insights: safety is a big concern, especially in a city.<br> The alert system would be most important to see immediately, so families feel that they know what’s going on in their neighborhood.<br> All the time-sensitive features, like daily goals and quick chat options must be easily found. I also realized that navigation must be easily <br>understandable and airtight, so every citizens from an elderly grandma to a teen could quickly find what they need. </p>
      <h3>Wireframes</h3>
      <p class = "body">I finally had an idea of how the information in the application should be organized, so I began sketching out the possibilities. </p>
      <img class = "img-asset" src = "img\smartcity\ideationDoc.jpg" style = "width: 60%">    
      <p class = "body">As a team, we decided that the interaction we wanted to showcase most was a user logging in to their home page,<br> swiping away an alert notification, and entering the quick chat feature with a doctor. I tried to iterate through ideas of how to lay out<br> the home page, as it felt like the hardest challenge. </p>
      <img src = "img\smartcity\wireframes.JPG" style = "width: 75%; margin-left: 50px;"> <br><br><br>
      <p class = "body">Finally, I was ready to begin work on the high fidelity wireframes. </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Shades of blue for simplicity and a relaxed vibe</li>
          <li>Redundant side menu to really lock in understanding of the available features</li>
          <li>Hierarchy of information on the home screen mirrors our takeaway from the personas and user interviews</li>

      </p>
      <h3>final takeaway</h3>
      <p class = "body">This was one of the most difficult projects I’ve produced, and doubly so because I was producing for a userbase that I didn’t quite understand. Study abroad not only brought me a better understanding of Spanish culture, but of the European business standard. The UX was honestly the easiest part—being a PM was tougher than I ever imagined. This was my first experience with budgeting for business, with directing a team, and making sure we not just delivered on time but on quality as well. At the end of the semester, not only was I incredibly proud of the product, but I was incredibly proud of my team as well.</p>
