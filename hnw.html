But as the user, it can be stressful and confusing to apply. BofA needed a way to guide users through all of the small print. <br><br> Erica, the bank’s financial digital assistant, would be the sole path to apply for a few months after release, and we were asked to create a response that would give users all the info they needed to apply.</p>

	        <h2>the ask</h2>
	        <p>The premium travel card space is highly competitive and highly rewarding. People spend hours comparing credit cards from companies like Chase and American Eagle, hoping to get the best deal of points and perks for a steep annual fee. When we kicked off this feature, our pod focused on our users first. When they asked Erica for help with the Premium Rewards Elite card, what were they really saying? We narrowed this down to three personas:</p>

	       			<br>
	       			<p style = "text-align: center; font-weight: 700;">Maybe I want a new card? Can I get all the info first?</p>
	       		</div>
	       		<div class = "col-4">
	       			<img style = "width: 110px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" src="img/hnw/no.png">
	       			<br>
	       			<p style = "text-align: center; font-weight: 700;">I defintely don’t want this card, but I’ll take a look at what else you got.</p>

			       	<p style = "text-align: left;">This was the draft mockup I made after our kick off. This was all of the immediate info our marketing team wanted us to include, but I had a few concerns.</p>

		    <br><br><br>
	       	<p style = "text-align: left;">To understand how other companies handled the complicated typography around credit card deals on a mobile screen, I did a quick and easy competitive analysis.</p>
		    <br><br>
	       	<img src = "img/hnw/comp.jpg" style = "width: 100%;">
		    <br><br><br>
	       	<p style = "text-align: left;">I liked the idea of exploring with interesting typography, or experimenting with icons in a way we haven't tried with Erica yet. The benefit of a multi modal experience is that we can push the visual envelope sometimes, so I was able to develop three ideas to bring to our first round of design review.</p>
		    <br><br><br><br>
		    <h3>design review: round 1</h3>
		    <br>
		    <div class = "row">
		    	<div class = "col-4"><img src = "img/hnw/dr1.jpg" style = "width: 60%; display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
		    	<div class = "col-4"><img src = "img/hnw/dr2.jpg" style = "width: 60%; display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
		    	<div class = "col-4"><img src = "img/hnw/dr3.jpg" style = "width: 60%; display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
		    </div>
		    <br>
	       	<p style = "text-align: left;">The biggest takeaways I had from our design review was that we had to cut down on the words on copy, make it easy to scan quickly, and try to keep Erica friendly rather than a salesperson (salesrobot)?</p>
       		<p style = "text-align: left;">And as much as I felt that the icons were an interesting path to explore, our tech teams let us know that it was out of scope for this feature. So, we focused on our third option and addressing the feedback.</p>
	  </div>
	</section>

	<section id="solution">
	    <div class="container-fluid">
	        <h2>solution</h2>
	        <br>
	      	<img src = "img/hnw/solution.jpg" style = "width: 60%; display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">
	      	<br><br>
	       	<p style = "text-align: left;">And this made it through, and can be seen in production today. If you’d like to see the whole interaction, go ahead and ask your Erica on your Bank of America app.</p>
		    <br><br><br><br>
	       	<h3>hindsight is always 2020</h3>
	       	<br><br>
	       	<p style = "text-align: left;">This was a fun quick project to work on in Erica, and the first time we were seeing Erica try to market a product to our users. We wanted to keep Erica’s friendly and informative personality intact, but also fufill the strategy laid out by marketing. While this was a relatively simple feature to get through, I learned a few things through this process:</p>
	       	<p style = "text-align: left;"> - It’s better to invite tech to the conversation early and often, so I didn’t spend too much time developing icons</p>
	       	<p style = "text-align: left;"> - In conversational design, you’re always thinking about what the user is asking for. From that lens, we did a good job answering all aspects of that question and allowing the conversation to continue down a different path</p>
	       	<p style = "text-align: left;"> - If I had more time, I’d love to explore interesting animations and illustrations</p>
