            <p>Team:  Michael Oladosu, Guriqbal Singh, Mohona Sengupta</p>
            <p>Role: UX Designer</p>
            <p>Objectives: Design the front-end for Droppin, a service platform focused on event sharing in the community.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 2019, Oladosu and Singh landed the first-place prize for The Wells Fargo Pathways to Success Program with a comprehensive start-up pitch. They evolved that initial idea to create <span class = "emphasisText">Droppin</span>, an application that would allow members of communities to drop “pins” of public and private events, invite friends, and create profiles. The ultimate goal of the application is to bring neighborhoods, college students, and cultural communities together. I was pulled onto the team when Oladosu and Singh needed an interactive front-end prototype to bring to the second-round conference in LA.</p>

  <section id="ideation">
    <div class="container-fluid">
      <h2 style = "text-align: left;">ideation</h2>
      <p class = "body">My first challenge was understanding exactly with Oladosu and Singh envisioned. <br>Like most entrepreneurs, their ideas were vast and exciting, but I needed to help them parse down the features. <br>As we met, we walked through their competitive analysis and user research, and I challenged them to develop an MVP <br>so that we could pinpoint the competitive edge of their application. In short, I wanted to find <br>the thing that made Droppin the best.</p>
      <p class = "body">I realized that we needed to find the exact pain points of creating, sharing, and hosting an event. <br>In order to focus our understanding, I created three personas that I felt best spanned the user base.</p>
      <br>
      <div class = "row">
        <div class = "col"><img class = "img-asset" src = "img\droppin\personas\Slide1.jpg"></div>
        <div class = "col"><img class = "img-asset" src = "img\droppin\personas\Slide2.jpg"></div>
        <div class = "col"><img class = "img-asset" src = "img\droppin\personas\Slide3.jpg"></div>
      </div>
      <br><br>
      <p class = "body">I wanted to pin point exactly where droppin could enter the user flow in order to smooth out this crazy process,<br> so I created a customer journey map to separate out the pain points associated with each stage of hosting an event.</p>
      <img class = "img-asset" style = "width: 75%" src = "img\droppin\journeymap.jpg"><br>
      <p class = "body">With the personas and customer journey map, Oladosu, Singh and I came to an agreement about the MVP for the platform:</p>
      <p class = "body">  
        <ul>
          <li>Allow EVENT HOSTERS to easily create events in 5 minutes or less</li>
          <li>Allow EVENT ATTENDANTS to quickly see any events they are invited to</li>
          <li>Allow ALL USERS to easily see all events in a location</li>
          <li>Allow ALL USERS to create profiles and save information like: past parties, ratings, and friends list for easy invitations</li>
        </ul>

      <p class = "body" style = "text-align: left;">For the presentation, we decided that the interaction we wanted to showcase would be a user setting up their account, creating an account, and seeing their "pin drop".</p>
